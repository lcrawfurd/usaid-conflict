Most of the debate around the USAID spending freeze has focused on health. The Lancet [estimated](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01186-9/fulltext) that 14 million lives could be lost by 2030 through disrupted health programs alone. But there's another channel that has received less attention: armed conflict.

A [new working paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6097746) uses ACLED conflict data to test whether the January 2025 USAID suspension led to more violence in aid-dependent countries. The finding: a significant increase in armed conflict events in countries with higher USAID exposure, with flat pre-trends and a sharp break right at the suspension date. But that paper only had data through June 2025---five months of post-treatment data. I extended their analysis through January 2026, nearly tripling the post-treatment window.

The armed conflict result holds up. If anything, it gets stronger.

## What the paper does

The design is a standard event study. Take all countries, measure their pre-existing USAID exposure (average disbursements per capita over 2015--2020), and then track conflict events month by month relative to the January 2025 suspension. The dependent variable is the inverse hyperbolic sine of conflict events per million people, with country and month fixed effects and standard errors clustered at the country level.

The key result is for **armed conflict** specifically---battles and explosions/remote violence. The paper also looks at social unrest, violence against civilians, and breakdowns by actor type (state forces, rebels, militias). Most of those are null. But armed conflict and militia violence both show clear positive effects.

## Extending through January 2026

The original paper used ACLED data through June 2025. ACLED updates weekly, so there are now data through January 2026---seven additional months. I replicated the paper's specification using the [GODAD](https://www.cesifo.org/en/publications/2025/working-paper/wedded-prosperity-informal-influence-and-regional-favoritism) geocoded aid data for USAID disbursements and the latest ACLED Africa data.

The results by conflict type:

- **Armed conflict**: flat pre-trends, then a sustained positive shift from Month 0 onwards. The difference-in-differences estimate is +0.14 in IHS units (p<0.001). The effect does not fade through Month 12.
- **All conflict**: noisy, no clear effect---consistent with the original paper.
- **Social unrest**: nothing.
- **Violence against civilians**: nothing.
- **Militia/mob violence**: my proxy here is rougher than the paper's (I only have event types, not actor codes), so this is harder to compare.

The armed conflict result is the one that matters, and it replicates cleanly. The pre-trends are flat, the break is sharp, and it persists well beyond the original paper's sample.

## Subnational evidence

The country-level analysis has an obvious weakness: there are only about 40 USAID-recipient countries in Africa, and the treatment---USAID exposure---varies only across countries. That's a lot of weight on a small number of units.

But we can do better. The [GODAD](https://www.cesifo.org/en/publications/2025/working-paper/wedded-prosperity-informal-influence-and-regional-favoritism) geocoded aid data records USAID disbursements at the admin1 (province/state) level, and ACLED records conflict events at admin1 too. Matching the two gives 740 admin1 regions across 41 countries---more than ten times as many units.

### Specification

The main estimating equation is a standard two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model:

$$y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \beta \left( \text{Post}_t \times \text{USAID}_i \right) + \varepsilon_{it}$$

where $y_{it}$ is the inverse hyperbolic sine of conflict events (or fatalities) per million people in admin1 region $i$ in month $t$; $\alpha_i$ are region fixed effects; $\gamma_t$ are month fixed effects; and $\text{USAID}_i$ is standardised average USAID disbursements per capita over 2015--2020. Standard errors are clustered at the admin1 level.

This specification uses variation in USAID exposure both *across* and *within* countries. A province in Somalia that received \$20 per capita is compared to a province in Kenya that received \$2 per capita, as well as to other provinces within Somalia. Since the aid freeze was a nationwide shock, the between-country variation is doing much of the work---which is a feature, not a bug, because that's where USAID exposure varies the most. But it does mean the estimate partly reflects cross-country differences.

As a robustness check, I replace the month fixed effects with country×month fixed effects:

$$y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_{c(i),t} + \beta \left( \text{Post}_t \times \text{USAID}_i \right) + \varepsilon_{it}$$

This absorbs *all* country-level time-varying shocks---anything common to regions within the same country in a given month---and restricts identification to *within-country* variation only. The coefficient $\beta$ is now identified from: within the same country, did provinces that received more USAID see relatively larger increases in conflict? This is a harder test. It will lose some countries that have little within-country variation in USAID, but it rules out the concern that results are driven by cross-country confounders.

### Results

![Subnational event study for armed conflict. Each coefficient shows the differential change in armed conflict in higher-USAID provinces. Pre-trends are flat; the post-suspension shift is positive and persistent.](figures/subnational_armed.png)

The result: the armed conflict coefficient is +0.050 (p=0.013) under TWFE, with standard errors clustered at the admin1 level. Adding country×month fixed effects---which restrict identification to within-country variation---the coefficient is similar at +0.047 (p=0.036). The "all conflict" measure is null under both specifications, consistent with the country-level analysis.

The results are robust across specifications: the effect survives whether we use between- and within-country variation (TWFE) or only within-country variation (country×month FE), and whether or not we add admin1-specific linear time trends (+0.032, p=0.030).

## How many deaths?

ACLED records not just conflict events but also fatalities, so we can estimate the effect on deaths directly rather than relying on a back-of-the-envelope calculation.

The subnational regression on armed conflict fatalities gives a DiD coefficient of +0.068 (p<0.001)---larger than the events coefficient (+0.050) and highly significant. With country×month fixed effects: +0.077 (p<0.001). With admin1-specific linear time trends on top: +0.048 (p=0.007). This suggests that the aid suspension didn't just increase the number of armed conflict events---the events that occurred were more lethal.

![Subnational event study for armed conflict fatalities. The pattern mirrors the events result but with a larger effect size, suggesting both more events and more lethal events in higher-USAID provinces.](figures/subnational_fatalities_armed.png)

In raw terms, armed conflict fatalities across USAID-recipient African countries ran at about 5,800 per month in the second half of 2024. In 2025 that rose to about 6,300---an excess of roughly **460 deaths per month**, or around **5,500 per year**. A cruder back-of-the-envelope based on the event count regression and ~3 fatalities per event gives a higher number---around 12,000 per year---because it weights by USAID exposure rather than using raw counts. The true figure is somewhere in that range.

The country breakdown tells the story. Somalia saw 360 more armed conflict fatalities per month in 2025 than in the second half of 2024. Nigeria saw 163 more. DRC saw 143 more. South Sudan saw 83 more. These are also among the countries with the highest USAID per capita---exactly the pattern the regression is picking up.

![Change in armed conflict fatalities per month vs USAID exposure. Countries with the largest increases in fatalities tend to be those most exposed to the aid freeze. Sudan is the major outlier, driven by its own civil war dynamics.](figures/scatter_fatalities_usaid.png)

Not every high-USAID country saw increases---Kenya and Ethiopia saw small declines---and Sudan, where conflict fell sharply, is a major outlier driven by its own civil war dynamics. But the overall pattern is clear: more USAID exposure, more conflict deaths.

Of course, you can argue with the parameters here. Both estimates assume the regression coefficient is causal and that nothing else changed differentially in high-USAID areas. And these numbers only cover *direct* conflict deaths in Africa. They don't include indirect deaths from disrupted health and food programs, displacement, or knock-on instability. The true human cost is almost certainly higher.

## What this means

There are now multiple pieces of evidence pointing the same direction. The Lancet paper estimated millions of health-related deaths from USAID cuts. This conflict paper, and my extension of it, suggests an additional toll through armed violence---on the order of 5,500--12,000 deaths per year in Africa alone, from armed conflict specifically. The subnational analysis, using variation in USAID exposure across 740 provinces, confirms the pattern---and the direct fatalities regression shows the effect is highly significant (p<0.001), robust to progressively more demanding fixed effects specifications.

These numbers should be taken as rough orders of magnitude rather than precise estimates. But the direction is clear, and the armed conflict event study is one of the cleanest causal designs in the emerging literature on the effects of the aid freeze.

The US and other donors that followed suit should be aware: cutting aid doesn't just stop programs. It creates vacuums that armed groups are ready to fill.
